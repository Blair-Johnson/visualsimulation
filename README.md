Interactive N-body particle simulations

### Play with different parameters such as:
- drag
- gravity
- coefficient of interaction
- attraction/repulsion
- minimum interaction distance

Plus mouse interaction with variable strength of attraction/repulsion

### TODO:
- Move particle management into particle manager
- Complete quadtree implementation and integrate with particle manager
- Replace texture blit with faster drawing method
- Add more complex interactions
